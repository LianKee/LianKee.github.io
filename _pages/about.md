I'm working at Tencent in Shenzhen now. I received my PhD degree from the [System Software and Security Laboratory](https://secsys.fudan.edu.cn/) at Fudan University in 2024, supervised by Professor [Min Yang](https://secsys.fudan.edu.cn/members/faculty/ym/), Professor [Yuan Zhang](https://yuanxzhang.github.io/), and Assistant Professor [Lei Zhang](https://zxlfd.github.io/). 

<!-- I completed my Bachelor's degree from Xiamen University in 2018. -->

My research interests are centered on code security and mobile security, particularly in vulnerability detection, analysis, and exploitation. To address these challenges, my research utilizes a variety of multidisciplinary techniques, including program analysis and fuzzing. I am also actively exploring the integration of **large language models** to enhance these methodologies.

Up to now, I have published several papers in the world's top conferences on cybersecurity and software engineering, such as S&P, USENIX Security, and FSE. My paper on Android component security was awarded the **Distinguished Paper Award at ACM FSE 2024**.
Furthermore, I have identified **150+ 0-day vulnerabilities**, with **70+ assigned CVE IDs**, and received acknowledgments from leading mobile manufacturers like Google, Huawei, vivo, Xiaomi, and open-source organizations such as Apache, Eclipse, RedHat, VMWare, and Oracle, etc.

<!-- In the field of mobile security, I have received **acknowledgments and high-severity vulnerability recognitions from Google** and reported vulnerabilities to well-known mobile manufacturers such as **Huawei, vivo, and Xiaomi**.
